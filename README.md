# ICSD-Java-Projects
Java projects completed as part of my university coursework (2013-2019, Information and Communications Systems Engineering, University of the Aegean), focusing on core programming and development skills.

(Some of them have been refactored, focusing on readability, new features and utilization of various code patterns).

- HW1: Local application for income/outcome management. usage of cryptography (symmetric and assymetric), hasing, salting, and digital signature.

- HW2: Distributed application for secure transfer of cryptographic keys (Key Exchange). "MultiKAP" is the application's name, "Client" is the member that starts the protocol, and "Server" the member that listens for the first message. Client chooses the Key Exchange method (Diffie Hellman, RSA, Station-to-Station), and both members then execute the chosen protocol. For avoiding Man in the Middle attacks, certificates were used (self-signed for simplicity).

- HW3: Distributed application for flight ticket reservations. Usage of Java RMI.

- HW4: Distributed application for announcement management.

- HW5: Local application for simulating a two dimension (2D) relation between preys and hunters.
